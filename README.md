OSRS-Python-Wrapper is a wrapper for the Hiscore and GE API's for Old School RuneScape.  
This simple wrapper makes working with the Hiscore and GE API's much easier, as the script does all the heavy work for you.

To use the wrapper, simply take the folder named "OSRS_Python_Wrapper" and place it in the same directory as the python file that will use it.
